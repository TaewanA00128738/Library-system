Library System Application
===========================

This is a simple library management system that allows users to create accounts, add books, borrow books, and return books. This application is packaged using PyInstaller.

Prerequisites:
--------------
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. `pip` (Python package installer) installed.

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
1. Clone the repository or download the `library_system.py` script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a terminal emulator on Linux/Mac).

3. Navigate to the directory where `library_system.py` is located.

4. Create a virtual environment:
   '''
   python -m venv myenv
   '''

   or

   '''
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ''''

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - On MacOS/Linux:
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

6. Install the required packages:
   '''
   pip install pyinstaller
   '''

7. Run the PyInstaller to create an executable:
   '''
   pyinstaller â€“onefile main.py
   '''

8. After the build process completes, you will find the executable file in the `dist` directory.

Running the Application:
------------------------
1. Navigate to the `dist` directory:
   '''
   cd dist
   '''

2. Run the executable:
- On Windows:
  ```
  library_system.exe
  ```
- On MacOS/Linux:
  ```
  ./library_system
  ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to create accounts, add books, borrow books, and return books.

Testing the Application:
------------------------
The `library_system.py` script includes unit tests using the `unittest` framework.

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the tests:
   '''
   python main.py
   ''''

The tests will automatically run, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.

Exiting the Application:
------------------------
To exit the application, simply select the '0' option from the main menu.

Deactivating the Virtual Environment:
-------------------------------------
After you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
   '''
   deactivate
   '''

Enjoy using the Library System Application!
